an appropriate <header> element
a <nav> element linking to each of the sections
an <h1> element with your page title (there can be only one)
a <section> element for each of the following, each of which should contain an appropriate heading element:

list of skills
Include whatever other information you consider pertinent.

skills / technologies used
an appropriate <footer> element
Lay out and style your portfolio
Assign ids/classes to sections/etc, then use css grid to lay out your page. Reference MDN and this tutorial to work out how to use grid: http://cssgridgarden.com/Links to an external site.
To contain the elements of your grid, you will want to create a <div>, something like <div id="container">...</div>.
Create CSS rules to style page elements appropriately.
Using online resources
Any resources (images, etc) you use should be:

free for non-commercial use
copied to your repository and referenced there rather than via a uri pointing to another site
Tips
Section ids can be used to create anchors linking to those sections inside the page.
See the appropriate Mozilla Developer Network reference pages for guidance regarding tag usage:
<header>Links to an external site.
<nav>Links to an external site.
<section>Links to an external site.
<article>Links to an external site.
